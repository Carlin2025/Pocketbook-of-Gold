                    A Pocketbook of Gold gives you, in one easy handbook <strong>(now only available as a PDF)</strong>, the reasons why you should own Gold, the timing of when you
                    should own Gold, and the types of Gold you should (and shouldn't) own. A Pocketbook of Gold also explains the
                    true role of Gold in every individual's financial planning, as well as Gold's place in the World monetary system. In its
                    new, re-released PDF format, the Pocketbook will answer your questions and guide you through the World of Gold as a
                    personal form of investment and financial insurance in today's increasingly uncertain financial outlook. A
                    Pocketbook of Gold is A Survival Manual for Monetary Mayhem.
